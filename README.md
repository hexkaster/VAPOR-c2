# V.A.P.O.R. 

**V**ysache's **A**utonomous **P**ropagation **O**bfuscation **R**outines  

*"Let your infrastructure quietly replicate itself."*

![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-1.67+-informational?logo=rust)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.0_Alpha-cyan)

A stealth-first C2 framework where infrastructure replication meets Rust-powered opsec.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Ephemeral Propagation**: Leave no disk artifacts through memory-resident agents
- **XOR Obfuscation Routines**: On-the-fly payload mutation to evade static analysis
- **Autonomous Replication**: Self-deploying agents via trusted process injection
- **TLS-Encrypted C2 Channels**: Mimics legitimate HTTPS traffic patterns
- **Plausible Deniability Architecture**: Agents self-terminate on forensic inspection
